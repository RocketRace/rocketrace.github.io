*still life* is an interactive painting on your computer screen. It responds to touch and to movement, to tugs and to gusts of wind. But, physicality comes with permanence -- there is no "undoing" a tear in the fabric.

With *still life*, I aimed to respond to the question of how to possibly imbue physicality into a digital object. The  piece mimics some of the physicality of a real painting, such as shaking and grazing. I focused on the destructibility of physical objects; all interactions with a physical object leave some form of permanent mark on them, be it wear or outright damage. Digital objects however have the strange privilege of living in a world without permanence. It is possible to undo or restore a document or an image to the precise same state that it was a week ago. Aside from the physical bit rot that happens to a device, it is possible for a digital object to stay entirely unchanged for years with next to no effort.

Much of the aesthetic inspiration for the piece came, surprisingly, from the sound effect in Hollow Knight: Silksong that plays when you rip apart a rosary necklace. You can hear the beads scattering and strings snapping. This brought me toward the idea of a pixel art that is "weaved" together like fabric, with threads running in two directions and holding the object together. In dividual pixels of a piece of pixel art are then beads within this strange tapestry, and tugging at a single bead brings the whole connected string along. I am intrigued by this concept and may even revisit it at some point.
