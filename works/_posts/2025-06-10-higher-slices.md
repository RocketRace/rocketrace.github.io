*Higher Slices* is a piece depicting a tesseract descending into three-dimensional space down from the heavens. Each slice of this higher-dimensional object is cradled by a meshwork of threads, a series of perfect geometric monoliths suspended in air by delicate organic strings.

The piece was exhibited in the summer of 2025 as part of the Fibrations (Säikeistyksiä) exhibit held by the Aalto University Math&Arts programme hosted at the Finnish Science Center Heureka.
