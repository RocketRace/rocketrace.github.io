Hi! I'm participating in [December Adventure][decadv] this year! In contrast
to a competitive advent calendar like [Advent of Code][aoc], it is a low-stakes
programming and journaling calendar taking place throughout december. I've
participated in AoC for the past few years, for example solving 2023's puzzle 
set [using a different programming language each day][my aoc2023]. But I feel
like now is the ideal time for me to take it easier and not to fuss about
completion times or implementating algorithms. I welcome the change of pace.

## Day 0

Today, I set up this page! I will be updating this page every day as my
adventure log. I have some plans for the projects I'll be working on -- in
particular I have ideas and a half-baked playground open on a different VSCode
window. More on that tomorrow :)
