I'm Olivia. I'm an artist and programmer creating in computational spaces. 
I study human-computer interactions and have a particular interest in 
programming language design -- I have designed a number of languages myself! 
I'm also broadly enthusiastic about mathematics, software, music, and video games.

The background image to this site is randomly generated! It's based on patterns I 
used to scribble onto graph paper as a teen.

I am in many places on the internet!
* On Discord, my tag is `rocketrace`.
* My [esolangs.org][my esolangs] page! I've designed and implemented a number of
  [esoteric programming languages][esolangs] that demonstrate beautiful and unexpected
  aspects of what programming can be.
* My [GitHub][github] has a record of all sorts of projects I've made in the past.

If you like this site, you might enjoy
* The Esolangs [Code Guessing][code guessing] competition. It features imaginative
  and cursed solutions to simple tasks, hosted frequently on the Esolangs Discord server!
  (Join in if you want!) My personal submissions are also [here][my cg], with commentary
  on each round.
* Other cool websites! This list is in no particular order :)
