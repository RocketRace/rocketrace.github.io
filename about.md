I'm Olivia. I'm an artist by heart and programmer by study. My enthusiasm stretches
from mathematics to software to music to video games to conceptual art, but I have
a particular passion for esoteric programming. I blog about my periodic fascinations.

The background image to this site is randomly generated! It's based on patterns I 
used to scribble onto graph paper as a teen.
